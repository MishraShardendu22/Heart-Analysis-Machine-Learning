# Heart Analysis — Machine Learning ❤️🔬

**A small project for exploring and modeling a heart disease dataset using Python and scikit-learn.**

---

## 📌 Project overview

- The repository contains a dataset (`heart.csv`) and an exploratory & modeling notebook (`Heart.ipynb`).
- The notebook covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install core packages manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

- Open the notebook and run it interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook Heart.ipynb
```

- Or open the repository in VS Code and run the notebook there.

> Tip: Run cells in order to reproduce preprocessing steps and model training results.
